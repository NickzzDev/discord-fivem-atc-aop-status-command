# discord-fivem-atc-aop-status-command
This Command shows the ATC/AOP Status of your FiveM Server! Very handy and easy! 

This Command uses Gamedig dependency, which needs to be downloaded by doing `npm i gamedig`.

This Command has been coded and provided by myself, in discord.js v12 and v13, in which i have provided my GitHub Credits in the Description. Please keep the credits as I made the command and providing it to you at ease!

Thanks, and hope you Enjoy!
